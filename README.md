<h2> Development and planning</h2>
<p>Performed hand drawn wireframe to get vision of a simple TicTacToe game before coding design. I decided to make a colorful interface that changes colors with hover function, featuring gameboard and start button.</p>
<p>I was able to use W3schools.com for ideas how to arrange and format squares, provide color, hover functionality, and label squares for selection. </p>
<p> After designing the UI I started the Javascript portion to satisfy the User Story/Requirements.  I was able to use Javascript to distiguish the squares and register a click for Player selection.  </p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  I ran into issues with using Javascript to get opponent side to play.  After getting stuck I researched tutorials and webpages to get examples and to see if I could get the game going by intergrating other coding ideas with my code. I was able to find examples and they were too advanced to understand well enough to get ideas for my own code.  
<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>
<p>I worked with an instructor to get a better understanding of what the code was doing. I started the Javascript coding to work through again. As of now, the HTML and CSS is working well with hover effects.  Javascript will require update to get Website fully functional.   </p>
