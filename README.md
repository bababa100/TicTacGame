<h2> Development and planning</h2>
<p>Performed hand drawn wireframe to get vision of a simple TicTacToe game before coding design. I decided to make a colorful interface that changes colors with hover function, featuring game-board and start button.</p>
<p>I was able to use W3schools.com for ideas how to arrange and format squares, provide color, hover functionality, and label squares for selection. </p>
<p> After designing the UI I started the Javascript portion to satisfy the User Story/Requirements.  I was able to use Javascript to distinguish the squares and register a click for Player selection.  </p>
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  I ran into issues with programming the opponent side to play.  After getting stuck I researched tutorials and webpages to get examples I could use to get the game working.  I was able to integrate other code with mine and had some successes. But the code was a bit too advanced to maintain through the additional requirements.  
<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>
<p>I worked with an instructor to get a better understanding of what the code was doing. He mentioned the code was a bit advanced for what we have been learning.  Using what I learned from my lessons, and the research Ive done while building this game, Ive restarted the Javascript coding from scratch and is ongoing. As of now, the HTML and CSS is working well with hover effects.  I am adding updates to Javascript to get Website fully functional.   </p>
