# Project-Tic-Tac
First Project Submit:  Tic Tac Game
Project #1: Tic Tac Toe
Overview:
Let's start out with something fun - a game! For your first project, you'll be creating a familiar game using HTML, CSS and JS!

This is an opportunity to be creative, and work through some tough programming challenges.

You will be working individually for this project, but we are here to support you and you are here to support each other. Show us what you've got!

Big Goals
Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
Use your programming skills to work out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
Build an application to a specification that someone else gives you
Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete from the same computer
Craft a README.md file that explains your app to the world
Technical Requirements
Your Tic Tac Toe app must:

Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
You can use GitHub Pages for deploying your project
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
Have well-formatted, and well-commented code
User Stories
As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page
Potential Extra Tic Tac Toe Features
Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win, lose and tie counter
Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
Use localStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
Involve Audio in your game
Create an AI opponent: teach JavaScript to play an unbeatable game against you
Make your site fully responsive so that it is playable from a mobile phone
Get inventive with your styling e.g. use hover effects or animations
Super Potential Extra Tic Tac Toe Features
Allow 2 players to play online with each other using any means such as WebSockets, Firebase, or other 3rd-party services.
README Suggestions

You must turn in something before presentations begin. However, you're welcome to continue working on it over the course of SEI and beyond!

With your submission please include any questions you'd like answered, or specific things on which you'd like us to focus when giving feedback.

Necessary Deliverables
A working game, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your Github repository
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A README.md file, including
Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
Follow this mini-lesson on writing documentation for your project
